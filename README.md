# cm-course
Coursework on computational methods

## Running locally
cm-course is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/) or [Gradle](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 11 or newer):

```
git clone https://github.com/pavkaz/cm-course.git
cd cm-course
mvnw clean install
mvnw spring-boot:run
```
